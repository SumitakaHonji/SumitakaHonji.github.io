# Welcome to my portfolio!

## Major
My research interests are modeling and controling soft robots from theoretical points of view.
Now I am trying to develop a control system for soft robotic system.
I am also interested in how humans control their body.
Espescially, I want to understand how to run fast in terms of robotics.
